## Welcome to Anastik's Pages

I'm interested in Github as lots of projects in the cryptospace seem to use this platform as a way to collaborate on their projects and to share their work with the community at large. 

I've got a little HTML, Python and Javascript experience from college, but I'm by no means an expert. I'm going to use Github to follow ICOs and projects that I think have a future in the crypto asset trading world.
